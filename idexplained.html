<span style="background-color:#BD87CB">In group competitions, the students in each group must share the same last digit as well as the first 4 digits</span><br />
That's because:<br />
Ids assigned to participants consist of 9 digits.<br />
<u>The first 3 digits</u> identify a school <br />
<u>The fourth digit</u> identifies a team from that school <br />
<u>The fifth digit</u> identifies the individual competition subject: 1: Algebra; 7: Geometry; 3: PreCalculus<br />
<u>The sixth digit</u> numbers the student from 1 to 4 in the individual subject<br />
<u>The last digit</u> is the same as the fifth digit (for error checking), except for those who take part in mixed group competition (in which case, the last digit is 0)<br />
<u>The 7th and 8th digits</u> together is the sum of all the other digits (for error checking)
