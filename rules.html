<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Session 1, Individual Competitions</span>:<br /> Each student will compete in one of the three areas: Algebra, Geometry and Pre-Calculus and each team should have four students competing in algebra, four in geometry and four in Pre-Calculus.
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Session 2, Group Competitions</span>:<br /> The group competitions will be of two types: Subject groups and Mixed groups.

<ul>
<li><u>Mixed Groups</u>: Three students, one sophomore, one junior and one senior will form the mixed group. Students in this group will solve problems that require knowledge of algebra, geometry and pre-calculus. This competition will assess how well students can cooperatively apply their knowledge in solving mathematical problems.</li>

 
<li><u>Subject Groups</u>: There will be three subject groups Algebra, Geometry and Pre-Calculus, consisting of three students each. Students in these groups will solve challenging problems in their respective subject areas.
